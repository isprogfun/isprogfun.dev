My website has moved from .ru domain to .dev domain. I moved from Russia more than 3 years ago, but all that time almost didn't touch it, except for one article about how I like to setup my blog instead of write into it. Expiration of .ru domain triggered me to do something again, because I didn't want to continue to pay for it, but I also didn't want to just close this project. I think this is the only running one left out of all (not many).

For some time I wanted to implement multiple languages and even write articles in two languages. But now my idea is to just change the basic UI to English and keep old posts as they are, maybe I should rename titles of the simplest projects I have that don't have any text inside. And new posts will be in English, not Russian or not even Danish :)
